# Code samples

This repository is a temporary collection of code I worked on over the past two years within various projects. Due permission has been obtained to share it publicly where necessary. The repo is divided in 3 categories:
- C# (ESA Phi-Lab, Master thesis)
- Python (ESA, Riscognition)
- JavaScript (Sen2Cube.at)

These samples are part of larger programs, the full source code of which are not available and with components of lesser interest for review. All of the C# and Python code was written by myself, while the JavaScript samples were written by someone else and heavily modified by myself.
